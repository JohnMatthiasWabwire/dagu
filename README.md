<h1><b>Dagu</b></h1>

## Overview

Dagu is a compact, portable workflow engine implemented in Go. It provides a declarative model for orchestrating command execution across diverse environments, including shell scripts, Python commands, containerized operations, or remote commands.

Dagu‚Äôs design emphasizes minimal external dependencies: it operates solely as a single binary without requiring an external database. A browser-based graphical interface (UI) is provided for real-time monitoring, rendering the status and logs of workflows. This zero-dependency structure makes the system easy to install and well-suited to various infrastructures, including local or air-gapped systems. This local-first architecture also ensures that sensitive data or proprietary workflows remain secure.

## Key Attributes

- **Small Footprint**
Dagu is distributed as a single binary with minimal resource overhead. It does not require additional components such as external databases, message brokers, or other services.

- **Language Agnostic**: Workflows in Dagu are defined by specifying tasks (called ‚Äústeps‚Äù) and their dependencies in YAML. A step can execute any command whether Python, Bash, Node.js, or other executables. This flexibility allows easy integration with existing scripts or tools.

- **Local-First Architecture**: Dagu was designed to run on a single developer workstation or server. By default, all tasks, logs, and scheduling run locally, allowing run offline or in air-gapped environments. This architecture ensures that sensitive data or proprietary workflows remain secure.

- **Declarative Configuration**: The workflow definition is contained in a YAML file. Dependencies, schedules, and execution details are declaratively expressed, making the workflow easy to comprehend and maintain.

- **No Complex Setup**: Unlike other orchestration platforms (e.g., `Airflow`) that often require substantial infrastructure, Dagu can be installed in minutes. Just `dagu start-all` command spins up both the scheduler and web UI, ready to run tasks immediately.

## Use Cases

- Data ingestion pipelines
- Data processing on small-scale/embedded systems
- Media file conversion tasks
- Automated workflows for employee onboarding and offboarding
- CI/CD automation

## Installation

Dagu can be installed in multiple ways, such as using Homebrew or downloading a single binary from GitHub releases.

### Via Bash script

**Install the latest version:**

```sh
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dagu-org/dagu/main/scripts/installer.sh | bash
```

**Install a specific version:**

```sh
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dagu-org/dagu/main/scripts/installer.sh | bash -s -- --version <version>
```

The `<version>` can be a specific version (e.g. `v1.16.10`)

**Install to a custom directory:**

```sh
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dagu-org/dagu/main/scripts/installer.sh | bash -s -- --install-dir <path>
```

### Via GitHub Releases Page

Download the latest binary from the [Releases page](https://github.com/dagu-org/dagu/releases) and place it in your `$PATH` (e.g. `/usr/local/bin`).

### Via Homebrew (macOS)

```sh
brew install dagu-org/brew/dagu
```

Upgrade to the latest version:

```sh
brew upgrade dagu-org/brew/dagu
```

### Via Docker

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.dagu
docker run \
--rm \
-p 8080:8080 \
-v ~/.dagu:/dagu \
-e DAGU_TZ=`ls -l /etc/localtime | awk -F'/zoneinfo/' '{print $2}'` \
ghcr.io/dagu-org/dagu:latest dagu start-all
```

Note: The environment variable `DAGU_TZ` is the timezone for the scheduler and server. You can set it to your local timezone (e.g. `America/New_York`).

See [Environment variables](https://docs.dagu.cloud/getting-started/quickstart) to configure those default directories.

### Quick Start

See the [Quick Start Guide](#quick-start-guide) to create and execute your first DAG!

## Building from Source

Dagu can be built and run locally from source.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Go 1.24 or later](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [Node.js (Latest LTS or Current)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

### Steps to Build Locally

#### 1. Clone the repository

- Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/dagu-org/dagu.git
  cd dagu
  ```

#### 2. Build the UI

- Build the UI assets. This step is necessary to generate frontend files and copy them to the `internal/frontend/assets` directory.
  ```sh
  make ui
  ```

#### 3. Build the Binary
- Build the binary
  ```sh
  make bin
  ```
  This produces the `dagu` binary in the `.local/bin` directory.

### Run Locally from Source

For a quick test of both server, scheduler, and UI:
```sh
# Runs "dagu start-all" with the `go run` command
make run
```
Once the server is running, visit `http://127.0.0.1:8080` to see the Web UI.

Continue with the [Quick Start Guide](#quick-start-guide) to create and execute your first DAG!
