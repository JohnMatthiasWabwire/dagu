    summary: "A compact, portable, and language-agnostic workflow engine. It aims to solve greater problems for developers."
    description: |
      Dagu is a compact, portable workflow engine implemented in Go. It provides a declarative model for orchestrating command execution across diverse environments, including shell scripts, Python commands, containerized operations, or remote commands.
      Daguâ€™s design emphasizes minimal external dependencies: it operates solely as a single binary without requiring an external database. A browser-based graphical interface (UI) is provided for real-time monitoring, rendering the status and logs of workflows. This zero-dependency structure makes the system easy to install and well-suited to various infrastructures, including local or air-gapped systems. This local-first architecture also ensures that sensitive data or proprietary workflows remain secure.
